# Usage via command line

To run the test, run the following command:

```bash
python3 test/test_mmd_to_iso.py
```

Make sure that your environment has access to a configuration file (or replace the path as described above) and that the module is importable.

To handle the path to the needed files and to avoid copying files across repositories the configuration library confuse is used.
The "confuse" library is used to pass the path string for static files consumed in the test.

From the confuse documentation:

On Linux systems, by default, confuse reads a configuration file from:
$HOME/.config/appname/config.yaml # in this code 'mdtool' is used as 'appname'
The confuse configuration file uses yaml syntax, an example is provided below:
paths:
    reference_mmd: 'path/to/reference_mmd.xml'
    reference_iso: 'path/to/reference_iso.xml'
    mmd2isocsw: 'path/to/mmd-to-iso.xsl'
    mmd_xsd: 'path/to/mmd_strict.xsd'
    logs: './logs/'
Consult the confuse documentation for more details. --

If you do not want (or can not) use the 'confuse' library:


replace the values of:
```python
reference_mmd
reference_iso
mmd2iso_xslt
# with the path strings to the files provided by your testing environment - e.g.: 
reference_mmd='path/to/reference_mmd.xml'
reference_iso='path/to/reference_iso.xml'
mmd2isocsw='path/to/mmd-to-iso.xsl'           
```

comment/remove the following lines:
```python
import confuse
config = confuse.Configuration('mmdtool', __name__)
```

Example files used in this test are from the mmd_repository, for convenience can be also found grouped as gist https://gist.github.com/934db4d3cf4e7a52985a3e231e0d36cf)
